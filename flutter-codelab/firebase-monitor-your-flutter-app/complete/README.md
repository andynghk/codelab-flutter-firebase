# Firebase 102 AB Testing

This code supports the [Firebase 102](todo) codelab. The directories are the state of the project at the end of the numbered step in the codelab.

--- 

The codelab for this app will discuss the following [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) products heavily:

- Emulator Suite
- Analytics
- Cloud Storage

If you're looking for guidance on these products, we recommend the [Getting to know Firebase with Flutter Codelab](https://github.com/flutter/codelabs/tree/main/firebase-get-to-know-flutter).
